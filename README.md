# DC-ReportData-2021-Database
This project defines the database, models and EF context for writing data to the ReportData database. The ReportData database is a persisted store of the apprenticeship monthly payment reports. This technique, of persisting the report data, as-is, makes QA processes around the reports much more streamlined (you can use SQL to verify answers as opposed to reading physical reports).
